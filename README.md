# rocket_monkey_job_manager

First thing to do is run bundle install in the directory.
After that, go in to configs and create a login.yml file properly
configured to your jenkins master ip address as well as credentials. 

From there the scripts in scripts/ need to be configured to 
suit your needs. Look at each file to see details on how to 
configure each one. For a concrete example look into the branch 
ss_cwf_job_manager which details how SS team has implemented the
scripts.
